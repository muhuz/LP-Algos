Python Implementation of algorithms to solve Linear Programs and more

Linear Programming problems are seen in a variety of disciplines. We see it come up in mathematics, economics, business, and more. Since it is so ubiquitous, I figured I should implement some of the algorithms that are used to solve linear programs to help me practice python as well as review some of the theory behind solving LPs. The algorithms I hope to implement include simplex, ellipsoid, and interior point methods.

I also did a paper giving an introduction to the theory and application of Semidefinite Programming, a generalization of Linear Programming. I include it in this repository because it is related to linear programming (and because I have no where else to put it).
